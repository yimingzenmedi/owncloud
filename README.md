# Loadbalancer
Since there is large and changing user demand, multiple web serviers are needed, so **load balancer** is needed to balance the data traffic
between these web servers, that means to decide which web server to use. To solve the problem of **session sharing**, we used `ip_hush` so one ip address will be connected to one spercific serverin a period.
