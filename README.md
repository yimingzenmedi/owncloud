# Loadbalancer
Since there is large and changing user demand, multiple web serviers are needed, so **load balancer** is needed to balance the data traffic between these web servers, that means to decide which web server to use, and to make sure these web servers can be **accessed via one ip address**. To solve the problem of **session sharing**, we used **ip_hush** so one ip address will be connected to one specific server in a period of time. We also built **reverse proxy** so all the access to the port 80 of the load balancer server will then be turned to the web servers.
