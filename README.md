# Loadbalancer
Since there is large and changing user demand, multiple web serviers are needed, so **load balancer** is needed to balance the data traffic between these web servers, that means to decide which web server to use. To solve the problem of **session sharing**, we used `ip_hush` so one ip address will be connected to one spercific serverin a period of time. To make sure these web servers can be **accessed via one ip address**, we built **reverse proxy** so all the access to the port 80 of the load balancer server will then be turned to the web servers.
